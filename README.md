# Description of Sample Codes

Here is some words about the sample codes.

The code is consisted of three parts:
1. PoDDyHePo-projection
2. my-previous-works
3. my-learning

## About [PoDDyHePo-projection](https://github.com/zauziii/PoDDyHePo-projection)

It is the first R pacakge that I made. It was built some years ago, so the codes may not be clean enough. The main purpose for this pacakge is to allow our audiences to produce something using the same method. Results can be found via [Development of non-communicable disease risk factors in Finland: projections up to 2040](https://doi.org/10.1177/14034948221110025).

## About [my-previous-works](https://github.com/zauziii/my-previous-works)

There are three folders in it. They are:

- [COVID19report](https://github.com/zauziii/my-previous-works/tree/master/COVID19report)
  
  This work focused on report automation. It semi-automatically outputs report to several formats (docx, pdf, pptx & xlsx). However, it is semi-automatic as manual works are needed when new data arrives. The templates show how the reports look like.
  
- [TobriskCov](https://github.com/zauziii/my-previous-works/tree/master/TobriskCov)

  This project is funded by [NordForsk](https://www.nordforsk.org/projects/addressing-smoking-paradox-etiology-covid-19-through-population-based-studies-tobrisk-cov). In this project, I am responsible for formal analysis, methodology and software. We studied the associations between tabocco use and vaccine uptake. Though the full text is not available online, you can discover something via [Tobacco Use and Uptake of COVID-19 Vaccinations in Finland: A Population-Based Study](https://doi.org/10.1093/ntr/ntad234).

- [RRPproj3](https://github.com/zauziii/my-previous-works/tree/master/RRPproj3/funcs)

  The project is ongoing, only some functions are available.

## About [my-learning](https://github.com/zauziii/my-learning)

R is my most used tool. However, Python is also popular in the field of data analysis. In order to keep myself familiar with Python, I reproduced some virtual projects and pushed them to this repository. 

[Analysis of LOL games](https://github.com/zauziii/my-learning/blob/master/LOLgames/LOLgames.ipynb) Could be a good start as the source [codes](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jonathanbouchet/lol-games-4-years-of-esport) were written in R. That is, I converted R codes to Python commands in this exercise.
